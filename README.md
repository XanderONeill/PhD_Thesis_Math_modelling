Matlab codes for all work completed within the Thesis titled 'Mathematical models for infectious diseases in ungulate populations' by Xander O'Neill

Each chapters code can be found in the respective folders, except in the case of Chapter 4, which is split into two due to the large amount of matlab scripts within each.
Within each script and function there is details on how to run the specific code and what it is used for.
